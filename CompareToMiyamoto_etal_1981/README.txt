This folder has some work that aimed to make the Itokawa model, in the other folder, comparable to the analytical model and approach by Miyamoto et al. (1981). 
Two bodies have already been produced by this modified finite difference model (using ModifiedModel_MiyamotoComparable.py) 
and they can be compared to the analytical solution from Miyamoto et al. (1981) by running SimpleMiyamotoModel.py.
This is not the primary model nor data. The code may also have less comments and be less straightforward and clear.
